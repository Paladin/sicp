* What is this?

  This is the seminal Structure and Interpretation of Computer
  Programs, Second Edition (SICP), converted to ePub format.

  The HTML version used low-resolution GIFs to represent complex
  layouts and non-ASCII characters. Wherever possible, I have replaced
  these with Unicode and HTML. There are still many diagrams and
  figures left, though. If you’d like to contribute, redrawing those
  in SVG would be an immense help.


* Why?

  Because I wanted to read it on my iPad, and I wasn’t happy with the
  existing digital editions.


* How do I use it?

  This is the raw source for the book. If you’d just like to read it,
  you’ll find what you’re looking for [[you’ll%20find%20what%20you’re%20looking%20for%20][in the downloads tab]].
